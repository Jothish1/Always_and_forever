        <h4>FIRSTLY MY POEM FOR YOU</h4>
        <p class="message">
Idk una patha appo una pathi therinjikanuk nu paatha <br>
 Ana yarukita kekanum nu therla<br>
 So avlo tha athuku aprom Sanjay story podum pothu tha unnoda Peru theriyum<br>
 Seri request kudukalama venama nu therla , ena unakuu theriyuma accept pannuvia nu therla<br>
 But I sent the req<br>
 You accept after 1 day<br>
 You cannot believe how much time I checked the phone , to see weather you accepted or not<br>
 Ni accept panna odana I was really excited<br>
 I checked you photos , you highlights<br>
 And I guessed ni lam high level girl enkuda la pesa vaipu illa nu<br>
 So ni poota oru story pic ku like poota<br>
 Aprom ennoda pic ku ni like poota<br>
 So aprom na story poota romba cautious ah irintha , pic la azhaga irikura maari poota😂<br>
 And ni like poota oru satisfaction<br>
 And you were way out of my league<br>
 So na vituta<br>
 Aprom ni onam ku msg panna<br>
And here we are husband and wife<br>
U canged all my perspective <br>
U made me realise kerela girls can be a gem also nu <br>
We chatted till 1 <br>
Although I had morning practice <br>
After someday you were my favourite notification <br>
Day and night, <br>
My first and last message was you <br>
I was clear not to be In love as it's of no use , because of our culture And you don't deserve a boy like me <br>
We meet I had a lot to speak, but I was unable <br>
Unnoda birthday gift was so special I really wanted to hug u and tell you thanks although I hated that gift <br>
Like cornetto I cream the end part of my college was made more beautiful because of you <br>
And one day although I had no work at college I came to meet you , damn it was worth the travel <br>
Sometimes in vc looking at you makes me think that why am I still here when I really wanted to be with you at church or at road fighting and holding hands <br>
So this will end someday so we will make the best of it before it does love <br>
        </p>
